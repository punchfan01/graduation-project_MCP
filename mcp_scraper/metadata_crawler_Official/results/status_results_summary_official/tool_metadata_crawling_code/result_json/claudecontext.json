    "description": "Search the indexed codebase using natural language queries within a specified absolute path. ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: - You MUST provide an absolute path. 🎯 **When to Use**: This tool is versatile and can be used before completing various tasks to retrieve relevant context: - **Code search**: Find specific functions, classes, or implementations - **Context-aware assistance**: Gather relevant code context before making changes - **Issue identification**: Locate problematic code sections or bugs - **Code review**: Understand existing implementations and patterns - **Refactoring**: Find all related code pieces that need to be updated - **Feature development**: Understand existing architecture and similar implementations - **Duplicate detection**: Identify redundant or duplicated code patterns across the codebase ✨ **Usage Guidance**: - If the codebase is not indexed, this tool will return a clear error message indicating that indexing is required first. - You can then use the index_codebase tool to index the codebase before searching again."
