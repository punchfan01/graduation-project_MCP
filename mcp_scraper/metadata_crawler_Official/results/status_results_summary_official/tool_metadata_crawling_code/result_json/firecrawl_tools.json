If batch scrape doesnt work, just use scrape and call it multiple times.\n**Other Features:** Use 'branding' format to extract brand identity (colors, fonts, typography, spacing, UI components) for design analysis or style replication.\n**Prompt Example:** \"Get the content of the page at https://example.com.\"\n**Usage Example:**\n\\"

    "description": "Starts a crawl job on a website and extracts content from all pages.\n \n **Best for:** Extracting content from multiple related pages, when you need comprehensive coverage.\n **Not recommended for:** Extracting content from a single page (use scrape); when token limits are a concern (use map + batch_scrape); when you need fast results (crawling can be slow).\n **Warning:** Crawl responses can be very large and may exceed token limits. Limit the crawl depth and number of pages, or use map + batch_scrape for better control.\n **Common mistakes:** Setting limit or maxDiscoveryDepth too high (causes token overflow) or too low (causes missing pages); using crawl for a single page (use scrape instead). Using a /* wildcard is not recommended.\n **Prompt Example:** \"Get all blog posts from the first two levels of example.com/blog.\"\n **Usage Example:**\n \\"
